#### ■Genre

Puzzle / Adventure / Psychological-horror / Top-down 2D rpg

&nbsp;

#### ■Synopsis

The game sets the stage in a closed nightclub in Wan Chai district, Hong Kong, unfolding a story between 1997 and 1998.

As the final pieces of a revenge plan come together, the protagonist cannot remember the person who always helped her.

Is it because of the covenant?

This is a tale of life, existence and memories.

While the theme is heartwarming, there are numerous puzzle-solving tasks and jump scare moments.

If after completion, you're interested in uncovering the real-life inspiration behind the character "Gao Suk" based on in-game clues, the author would be delighted.
